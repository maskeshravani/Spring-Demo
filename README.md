# Spring-Demo
Student-Country Relationship: 
Property-based DI between Student (ID, name, address) and Country (ID, name) classes using springbeans.xml.

Register-Login Relationship: Constructor-based DI between Register (user details) and Login (credentials) entities.
Both examples use Maven (spring-core, spring-context) for setup. 

Run the respective Main classes after configuring the project to observe DI in action.
